# TE KI TOA

TE KI TOA - Personal project. The goal of this project is to create a website to present my twitch show TE KI TOA.
Welcome to TE KI TOA, I'm Mauc and today I'm presenting you my show which will make you discover a lot of small streamers !
Every Wednesday at 6pm on Twitch, a small streamer will join my live show and we will learn to discover him.
The objective of this evening? To retrace all his journey on twitch and internet since he became a streamer.
So, do you want to discover a new person every week and increase your catalogue of your favourite streamers?
Grab your best cold coke, get comfortable and enjoy the videos!
